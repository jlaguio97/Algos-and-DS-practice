Prompt: Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. If the input array is empty, the function should return 0.

Sample Input:
array = [75, 205, 120, 75, 90, 135];

Sample Output:
330 // 75 + 120 + 135

Approach: We want to iterate through the array and keep track of the current sum that we have between our current number, and the number that is positioned at the next non-adjacent index.


Hints:
1. Try building an array of the same length as the input array. At each index in this new array, store the maximum sum that can be generated using no adjacent numbers located between index 0 and the current index.

function maxSumsetSumNoAdjacent(array) {

}
